A programmer is walking along a beach and finds a lamp.  He rubs the lamp, and a genie appears.  “I am the most powerful genie in the world.  I can grant you any wish, but only one wish.” 

The programmer pulls out a map, points to it and says, “I’d want peace in the Middle East.” 

The genie responds, “Gee, I don’t know.  Those people have been fighting for millenia.  I can do just about anything, but this is likely beyond my limits.” 

The programmer then says, “Well, I am a programmer, and my programs have lots of users.  Please make all my users satisfied with my software and let them ask for sensible changes.”

At which point the genie responds, “Um, let me see that map again.”

Computer Stupidities

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Comedy Code is syntactically correct programming code written just for fun.  The code doesn’t actually have to do anything if it’s executed, but it should look like regular code.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Why computers are like men:

    In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.
    They have a lot of data, but are still clueless.
    They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they are the problem.
    As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model.

Why computers are like women:

    No one but the Creator understands their internal logic.
    The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.
    Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.
    As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.

Laws of Computer Programming

    Any given program, when running, is obsolete.
    Any given program costs more and takes longer.
    If a program is useful, it will have to be changed.
    If a program is useless, it will have to be documented.
    Any program will expand to fill available memory.
    The value of a program is proportional to the weight of its output.
    Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capabilities of the programmer who must maintain it.
    Any non-trivial program contains at least one bug.
    Undetectable errors are infinite in variety, in contrast to detectable errors, which by definition are limited.
    Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Lubarsky’s Law of Cybernetic Entomology: There’s always one more bug.
    Shaw’s Principle: Build a system that even a fool can use, and only a fool will want to use it.
    Woltman’s Law: Never program and drink beer at the same time.
    Gallois’ Revelation: If you put tomfoolery into a computer, nothing comes out but tomfoolery. But this tomfoolery, having passed through a very expensive machine, is somehow enobled, and no one dares to criticize it.

A programmer finds himself in front of a committee that decides whether he should go to Heaven or Hell.  The committee tells the programmer he has a say in the matter and asks him if he wants to see either Heaven or Hell before stating his preference.

“Sure,” the programmer replies.  “I have a pretty good idea what Heaven is like, so let’s see Hell.”  So an angel takes the programmer to a sunny beach, full of beautiful women in skimpy bikinis playing volleyball, listening to music and having a great time.  “Wow!” he exclaims, “Hell looks great!  I’ll take Hell!”

Instantly the programmer finds himself in red-hot lava with demons tearing at his flesh.  “Where’s the beach?  The music?  The women?” he screams frantically to the angel.

“That was the demo,” the angel replies as she vanishes.

Jesus and Satan have an argument as to who is the better programmer.  This goes on for a few hours until they come to an agreement to hold a contest with God as the judge.  They set themselves before their computers and begin.  They type furiously, lines of code streaming up the screen, for several hours straight.

Seconds before the end of the competition, a bolt of lightning strikes, taking out the electricity.  Moments later, the power is restored, and God announces that the contest is over.  He asks Satan to show his work.  Visibly upset, Satan cries and says, “I have nothing.  I lost it all when the power went out.”

“Very well,” says God, “let us see if Jesus has fared any better.”

Jesus presses a key, and the screen comes to life in vivid display, the voices of an angelic choir pour forth from the speakers. 

Satan is astonished.  He stutters, “B-b-but how?!  I lost everything, yet Jesus’ program is intact!  How did he do it?”

God chuckles, “Everybody knows… Jesus saves.”
